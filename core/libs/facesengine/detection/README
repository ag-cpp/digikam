opencv-dnn   : face detection based on OpenCV neural network models.
opencv-face  : legacy face detection based on OPenCV Haar cascades models.
facedetector : top level wrapper to perform face detection.
               Model selection is done at compilation time with a pre-processing macro.
               DNN is the default model.
