TODO list for post-GSoC 2019 on backend of face recognition:
* Remove old codes of face recognition algorithms (e.g. LPBH, FisherFace, EigenFace) and dead codes in facesengine/detection/opencv3-face
* New face clustering algorithms should be studied and implemented. A candidate can be [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359265 Density-Based Multiscale Analysis for Clustering in Strong Noise Settings With Varying Densities] (DBMAC/DBMAC-II).
