 * Description : Alignment by Image Congealing.
 *               Funneling for complex, realistic images
 *               using sequence of distribution fields learned from congealReal
 *               Gary B. Huang, Vidit Jain, and Erik Learned-Miller.
 *               Unsupervised joint alignment of complex images.
 *               International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2007.
 *               Based on Gary B. Huang, UMass-Amherst implementation.
