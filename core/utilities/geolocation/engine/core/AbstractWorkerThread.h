/**
 * The AbstractWorkerThread is a class written for small tasks that have to run
 * multiple times on different data asynchronously.
 * You should be able to use this class for many different tasks, but you'll have to
 * think about Multi-Threading additionally.
 * The AbstractWorkerThread runs the function work() as long as workAvailable()
 * returns true. If there is no work available for a longer time, the thread will
 * switch itself off. As a result you have to call ensureRunning() every time you
 * want something to be worked on. You'll probably want to call this in your
 * addSchedule() function.
