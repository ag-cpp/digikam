/**
   Life of a HttpJob
   =================
   - Job is added to the QueueSet (by calling addJob() )
     the HttpJob is put into the m_jobQueue where it waits for "activation"
     signal jobAdded is Q_EMITted
   - Job is activated
     Job is moved from m_jobQueue to m_activeJobs and signals of the job
     are connected to slots (local or HttpDownloadManager)
     Job is executed by calling the jobs execute() method

   now there are different possibilities:
   1) Job Q_EMITs jobDone (some error occurred, or canceled (kio))
      Job is disconnected
      signal jobRemoved is Q_EMITted
      Job is either moved from m_activeJobs to m_retryQueue
        or destroyed and blacklisted

   2) Job Q_EMITs redirected
      Job is removed from m_activeJobs, disconnected and destroyed
      signal jobRemoved is Q_EMITted
      (HttpDownloadManager creates new Job with new source url)

   3) Job Q_EMITs dataReceived
      Job is removed from m_activeJobs, disconnected and destroyed
      signal jobRemoved is Q_EMITted

   so we can conclude following rules:
   - Job is only connected to signals when in "active" state


   questions:
   - update of initiatorId needed?
     "We update the initiatorId as the previous initiator
      likely doesn't exist anymore"
   - blacklist or black list?
